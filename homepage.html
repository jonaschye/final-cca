    <h1>Why I Enjoy Wes Anderson's Work</h1>
    <p>I was introduced to Wes Anderson's films when I first watched The Grand Budapest Hotel. It is his most famous and critically acclaimed movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
        However, I fell in love with his work when I watched Rushmore. From then I truly began understanding his style. Robert Yeomen, the cinematographer of all of Wes Anderson's films also deseverve alot of credit.
        The fast pace and quirkiness of his movies, as well as the gorgeous shots are why I enjoy his work so much. His movie scores are also very enjoyable to listen to.

    <p>Fantastic Mr.Fox is my favourite movie. It has endless amounts of style and soul in it, and amazing stop-motion to go along with it.</p>
